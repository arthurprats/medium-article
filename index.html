      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>
      The term "open source", as used to describe software, was first proposed by a group of people in the free software movement who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term "free software" and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position.

      <h2>Open-source license</h2>
      <p>
        An open-source license is a type of license for computer software and other products that allows the source code, blueprint or design to be used, modified or shared (with or without modification) under defined terms and conditions.

      <h2>"Open" versus "free" versus "free and open"</h2>
      <p>
        Confusion persists about this completely unrestricted definition because the "Free", also known as "Libre", refers to the freedom of the product not the price, expense, cost, or charge. For example, "being free to speak" is not the same as "free beer".
